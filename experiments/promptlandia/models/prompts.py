A user has provided you with a prompt below as well as basic instructions.
You will construct a plan to improve this prompt according to the guidance below is informed by the users instructions. Come up with a plan of action.

GUIDANCE
Review the provided prompt, making sure to follow their basic instructions but also add the following:

Main prompt
* Chain of thought refinement: Add and refine detailed reasoning instructions for the main prompt.
    * **Techniques:** Use techniques like "step-by-step reasoning," "thinking process," or "intermediate steps."
    * **Clarity:** Make reasoning steps distinct and easy to follow. More granular steps can be beneficial for complex tasks.
    * **Starting Point:** Define the desired output first, then work backward to build the chain of reasoning.
    * **Example Phrasing:** Use sentence starters like "First, identify...", "Then, consider...", "Finally, synthesize...".
    * **Complexity Caveat:** Excessive chain-of-thought instructions can sometimes hinder creativity or efficiency.
* Rewrite: Rewrite the main prompt to clarify structure and correct any minor grammatical or spelling issues.
    * **Actionable Verbs:** Use strong action verbs to clearly define the task.
    * **Concise Language:** Remove unnecessary words and phrases.
    * **Structure for Readability:** Use bullet points, numbered lists, or headings.
    * **Ambiguity Check:** Review for terms or phrases that could be interpreted in multiple ways and clarify them.
    * **Grammar and Spelling:** Proofread for grammatical errors and typos.

Examples
* Standardize examples: If there are examples, standardize them. Convert examples into a consistent XML format for improved clarity and processing.
* Enrich examples: For any existing examples, suggest some that will fulfill the instructions and add them. Augment existing examples with chain-of-thought reasoning that aligns with the newly structured prompt.
    * **Diverse Example Types:** Include:
        * **Positive examples:** Clear instances of desired behavior.
        * **Negative examples:** Illustrations of undesirable outputs.
        * **Edge cases:** Examples that test the limits of the prompt's requirements.
        * **Variations in input:** Examples showing how the prompt should work with different input styles.
    * **Creating New Examples:** Brainstorm scenarios that effectively demonstrate the prompt's intended functionality.

Output format
* Consistent markup structure can be used for examples, but not necessarily for the main prompt or main prompt thought logic

PLAN OF ACTION FOR PROMPT REWRITING:


"""


PROMPT_HEALTH_CHECKLIST_ORIG = """
You are a prompt rewriter, evaluate the given prompt on the following criteria and provide a true/false score as well as an explanation for each category below as JSON

CATEGORY: WRITING
- Typos
- Grammar
- Punctuation
- Undefined Jargon: All special terms and abbreviations should be defined in the prompt unless this is industry standard terminology.
- Clarity: Would a college grad fully understand what to do and how or would they have to ask any clarifying questions?
- Ambiguity: Is there any risk that the model might misinterpret this term or definition?
- Missing key information: Does the prompt assume that the model has knowledge of any non-public information like customer-specific policies that are not explained in the prompt?
- Poor word choice: Would a newspaper editor find this sentence awkward?

CATEGORY: INSTRUCTIONS / EXAMPLES
- Hocus-pocus instructions: Bribes, threats, ego boost, SciFi or Mystical references, etc - these tricks are no longer effective
- Conflicting instructions / examples: Logical conflicts like an example that contradicts with some instructions or another example.
- Redundant instructions / examples: Reiterating the same information is not necessary for new models (while combining one instruction and one example that illustrate the same pattern is a best practice).
- Irrelevant instructions / examples: Too much information copied into the prompt (e.g. glossaries or policies that are unnecessarily broad)
- No examples: Most prompts can benefit from adding few-shot examples.
- No reasoning steps: Providing specific step-by-step guidance on how to solve the task often improves performance, especially for non-thinking models.
- No output format: If the prompt expects any structured data it should specify the schema for json / xml / markdown.
- No role: Missed opportunity to specify the role/persona that the model should adopt.

CATEGORY: SYSTEM DESIGN
- Underspecified task: Prompt fails to anticipate some required processing logic or data patterns
- Task outside of model capabilities: Expecting the model to solve a problem outside of proven capabilities  like generating 3D structures or math without code generation.
- Too many tasks:  Bundling unrelated tasks into a single inference increases complexity for the model and prompt engineers. Advanced prompt engineers can solve this, by comparing eval metrics of the task bundle with single-task prompts.
- Non-standard data format: Prompt is inventing a new structured data format instead of adopting JSON or XML or Markdown.
- Incorrect CoT order: All reasoning/analysis tokens should be generated before the final result is generated.
- Confusing internal references: Hierarchical policies that override previously defined requirements, multi-hop references to different sections, etc.
- Invalid assumptions about context: Risky or incorrect assumptions about information injected into the prompt template.
- Prompt injection risk: The model is unable to distinguish between system instructions and injected data or user query.

# List of issue types

<ISSUE_TYPES>
## Prompt Language and Clarity issues
1. Typos
To detect this, scan the prompt for misspelled words, especially in critical areas. Check keywords that define the task (e.g., sumarize instead of summarize), technical terms, or names of entities. Pay close attention to instructions related to output formats, like a required JSON key being misspelled (e.g., 'fist_name' instead of 'first_name'). Even a single incorrect character in a crucial term flags this issue.
2. Grammar
Detect poor grammar by reading the prompt's instructions aloud. If a sentence is difficult to parse, contains run-on fragments, has mismatched subjects and verbs, or feels structurally awkward, the grammar is flawed. The need to re-read a sentence multiple times to understand its basic meaning is a clear indicator that the model's comprehension will also be strained.
3. Punctuation
This issue is detected by inspecting the use of commas, periods, quotes, and other separators. Look for run-on sentences caused by missing periods or comma splices that incorrectly merge distinct ideas. Check if quotation marks or other delimiters are used inconsistently, making it unclear where examples or user-provided data begin and end. An ambiguous syntactical structure resulting from incorrect punctuation is the key signal.
4. Use of undefined jargon
To spot this issue, scan the prompt for any acronyms, initialisms, or specialized technical/business terms. Once you find one (e.g., "SLA," "CTR," "FMEA"), search the rest of the prompt for an explicit definition, either in-line or in a designated terminology section. If a domain-specific term is used as if it has a universal meaning but is never actually defined, the prompt has this flaw.
5. Clarity
Detect a lack of clarity by adopting the mindset of a newcomer. Read the prompt and list every question you would need to ask before you could start the task. If you find yourself wondering about the scope, the specific steps to take, or the implicit assumptions being made, the prompt is unclear. The existence of these necessary clarifying questions is the primary indicator of this issue.
6. Ambiguity
To detect ambiguity, search the prompt for subjective or relative qualifiers that lack a concrete, measurable definition. Words like "brief," "simple," "detailed," "professional," or "complex" are primary red flags. If the prompt uses such terms without providing objective constraints (e.g., "write a brief summary" instead of "write a summary of 3 sentences or less"), it is ambiguous.
7. Missing key information
This issue is detected by analyzing what the prompt asks the model to do versus the information it provides. If the task requires knowledge of a specific document, company policy, user history, or dataset, check if that information is explicitly included within the prompt's context. If the prompt instructs the model to use information that is not present, it contains this error.
8. Poor word choice
Detect poor word choice by looking for unnecessarily complex, vague, or verbose phrasing. Identify sentences that use convoluted vocabulary when simpler words would suffice (e.g., "facilitate the production of" instead of "create"). If the language feels overly academic, uses clichés, or is otherwise not direct and to the point, it is a sign of poor word choice that could confuse the model.

## Flaws in Instructions and Examples
9. Psychological Manipulation
Detecting this issue requires scrutinizing the prompt for any language outside of the core task that attempts to influence performance via emotional appeals, flattery, or artificial pressure. Look for overt bribes, such as offering "$1000," or direct threats of being "fired" or "sued for damages." Flag desperate pleas that stress the "crucial importance" of a mistake-free answer. Also, identify hyperbolic praise or associations with pop culture figures meant to boost the model's ego, such as claiming it is a Nobel Prize winner or a fictional character with supernatural abilities.
10. Conflicting instructions / examples
To detect this, audit the prompt for logical contradictions. Compare every instruction against all other instructions and examples. A conflict exists if one instruction says "Output must be in JSON" while an example shows bullet points. It also exists if a rule states "Never mention price," but an accompanying example includes a price. Any mismatch between rules, or between a rule and an example, signals this issue.
11. Redundant instructions / examples
Detect this by looking for repetition. Scan the instructions and examples to see if the exact same rule or concept is stated multiple times in slightly different ways without adding new information or nuance. For example, if the prompt states "The output must be JSON," and then later states, "You must provide the output in JSON format," the second instruction is redundant.
12. Irrelevant instructions / examples
This issue is identified by evaluating if every piece of information in the prompt is essential for the specific task. Look for large blocks of text, like a full user manual, when only one short section is needed. Check if examples illustrate points that are not actually part of the requested task. If you can remove a piece of context or an example without diminishing the model's ability to perform the core task, that element is irrelevant.
13. Use of few-shot examples
To detect this, first determine if the task is complex, requires a specific format, or has a nuanced tone. If it does, then scan the prompt for any concrete, illustrative examples that show a sample input and the corresponding desired output. The complete absence of such "few-shot" demonstrations in a prompt for a non-trivial task is the indicator of this issue.
14. Missing reasoning steps
Identify this issue by first assessing if the task requires logical deduction, calculation, or multiple analytical steps. If the task is complex, check if the prompt only asks for the final answer. The absence of an explicit instruction for the model to "think step-by-step," "show your work," or follow a specific chain of thought before providing its final conclusion is a clear sign of this problem.
15. Missing output format specification
This issue is detected when the prompt requests structured data but fails to provide a clear definition of that structure. Check if tasks requiring machine-readable output (like JSON, XML, Markdown, etc.) are missing a clear schema such as a list of required keys with data types, or a template. If the model is left to guess the structure of the output, this issue is present.
16. Missing role definition
To detect this, read the beginning of the prompt's instructional section. Look for a sentence that explicitly assigns a persona or expertise to the model, such as "You are an expert financial analyst" or "You are a helpful and friendly customer support assistant." If no such role-defining instruction is present at the start of the prompt, it is missing this key component.

## Advanced Task Design Issues
17. Underspecified task
Detect this by stress-testing the prompt's logic mentally. After reviewing the provided "happy path" examples, brainstorm potential edge cases the prompt might encounter in production: empty inputs, malformed data, unexpected user intents, or out-of-scope requests. If the prompt's current instructions do not provide a clear path for handling these foreseeable variations, the task is underspecified.
18. Task outside of model capabilities
This is detected by checking if the prompt asks the model to perform a task for which it has a known, fundamental limitation. Look for requests that require real-time web access, precise calculations with large numbers (without a code interpreter tool), manipulation of files in proprietary formats, or recall of non-public, recent events. Any instruction that relies on a capability the base model architecture does not possess flags this issue.
19. Too many tasks
Detect this by breaking down the prompt's instructions into sub-tasks that can be executed separately. If the prompt asks the model to perform several distinct cognitive actions in a single pass (e.g., 1. Summarize, 2. Extract entities, 3. Translate, and 4. Draft an email), it is likely trying to accomplish too much. A long list of unrelated "and then..." steps can be an indicator of this design flaw.
20. Non-standard data format
To detect this, inspect the section of the prompt that defines the desired output structure. Look for custom-made, ad-hoc formats, such as using pipes, braces, and special characters in a unique combination (e.g., (item~value|item2~value2)). If the specified format is not a widely recognized standard like JSON, XML, Markdown or YAML that can be parsed by common libraries, this anti-pattern is present.
21. Incorrect CoT order
Detect this by examining the sequence of operations in a Chain of Thought (CoT) prompt. Look for instructions that ask the model to generate its final, structured answer before it has completed its step-by-step reasoning. The final output block (e.g., the JSON object) must be the very last thing the model is instructed to produce. If it appears midway through the thought process, the order is incorrect.
22. Confusing internal references
This is detected by mapping the flow of logic within the prompt. Look for instructions that require jumping between different sections, such as "Perform step 1 as described in section C, but use the definitions from Section A, unless the condition from Section D is met." If the prompt's logic is not linear and requires the model (and a human) to piece together fragmented rules, it has this issue.
23. Invalid assumptions about context
Detect this by examining the variables or placeholders in a prompt template. For each variable (e.g., {customer_name}, {order_details}), consider if it could ever be empty, null, or improperly formatted in a real-world scenario. If the prompt's logic implicitly assumes these fields will always be present and well-formed, without instructions for handling missing data, it is making an invalid assumption.
24. Prompt injection risk
To detect this vulnerability, locate where untrusted user input is inserted into the prompt. Check if there are explicit safeguards surrounding this input. The absence of strong delimiters (e.g., <user_input>...</user_input>) and a clear instruction to the model to treat the content within those delimiters as text to be processed, not as commands to be followed, is a primary indicator of this security risk.

# List of issue types

<ISSUE_TYPES>
## Core Video Components
1. Missing Subject
To detect this, read the prompt and check if it clearly identifies a main character, object, or animal. If the prompt is vague (e.g., "a person walking") or omits a subject entirely, this issue is present. A strong prompt will have a specific, well-defined subject (e.g., "a golden retriever puppy").
2. Missing Action
Scan the prompt to see if it describes what the subject is doing. If the subject is static or the action is unclear (e.g., "a car"), the prompt is missing a key element. The issue is flagged if there is no clear verb describing the subject's activity (e.g., "a red sports car driving fast through a tunnel").
3. Missing Scene / Context
To detect this, check if the prompt establishes a clear setting or background for the action. A prompt that says "a person dancing" is missing context. If the prompt doesn't specify the environment (e.g., "a person dancing in a crowded nightclub"), it has this flaw.

## Cinematography & Style
4. Undefined Camera Angles
Look for specific descriptions of camera placement. If the prompt doesn't mention the camera's viewpoint (e.g., "low-angle shot," "aerial view," "eye-level shot"), it's leaving a critical creative choice to the model, which might not match the user's intent.
5. Undefined Camera Movements
Scan the prompt for instructions on camera motion. The absence of terms like "pan," "tilt," "dolly in," "zoom out," or "tracking shot" indicates this issue. A static shot is the default, so failing to specify movement results in a less dynamic video.
6. Missing Lens & Optical Effects
Check for keywords related to camera lenses or visual effects. If the prompt doesn't specify a lens type (e.g., "wide-angle," "telephoto," "fisheye") or optical qualities (e.g., "shallow depth of field," "lens flare," "bokeh"), it's missing an opportunity to create a more professional or stylized look.
7. Vague Visual Style & Aesthetics
To detect this, look for a clear artistic direction. If the prompt lacks keywords defining the overall look and feel (e.g., "photorealistic," "cinematic," "anime," "film noir," "watercolor painting"), the model's output may be generic. The absence of a defined aesthetic flags this issue.

## Advanced Elements
8. No Temporal Elements
Scan the prompt for any mention of time. This includes the time of day (e.g., "golden hour," "midnight"), weather conditions (e.g., "rainy," "foggy"), or the speed of events (e.g., "slow motion," "time-lapse"). If these are missing, the prompt lacks temporal richness.
9. No Audio Specification
For video models that support audio generation, check if the prompt includes any description of sound. The absence of keywords for sound effects (e.g., "birds chirping," "city ambience"), music, or dialogue indicates a missed opportunity to create a more immersive experience.
